    for the profit of generative applications. This encourages employing such hardware

  abstract: 'Summary Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of neural networks
    as variational ansatz functions for quantum many-body states. However, high-dimensional
    sampling spaces and transient autocorrelations confront these approaches with
    a challenging computational bottleneck. Compared to conventional neural networks,
    physical model devices offer a fast, efficient and inherently parallel substrate
    capable of related forms of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we demonstrate
    the ability of a neuromorphic chip to represent the ground states of quantum spin
    models by variational energy minimization. We develop a training algorithm and
    apply it to the transverse field Ising model, showing good performance at moderate
    system sizes (N{$\leq$}10). A systematic hyperparameter study shows that performance
    depends on sample quality, which is limited by temporal parameter variations on
    the analog neuromorphic chip. Our work thus provides an important step towards

    entanglement such as entanglement entropy, the study of entanglement structure
    in terms of the entanglement spectrum has shifted to a focus leading to new insights
    into fractional quantum Hall states and topological insulators, among others.
    What remains a challenge is the experimental detection of such fine-grained properties
    of quantum systems. The development of protocols for detecting features of the
    entanglement spectrum in cold-atom systems, which are one of the leading platforms
    for quantum simulation, is thus highly desirable and will open up new avenues

    cold atoms in lattice geometries, requiring only measurements in two experimentally
    accessible bases and utilizing ballistic time-of-flight (TOF) expansion. Building
    on previous proposals for entanglement certification for photon pairs, we first
    consider entanglement between two atoms of different atomic species and later
    generalize to higher numbers of atoms per species and multispecies configurations

    based on entropic uncertainty relations. Experimentally quantifying entanglement
    is highly desired for applications of quantum simulation experiments to fundamental
    questions, e.g. in quantum statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics.
    At the same time it poses a significant challenge as the evaluation of entanglement
    measures typically requires the full reconstruction of the quantum state, which
    is extremely costly in terms of measurement statistics. We derive an improved
    entanglement bound for bipartite systems, which requires measuring joint probability
    distributions in only two different measurement settings per subsystem, and demonstrate
    its power by applying it to currently operational experimental setups for quantum
    simulation with cold atoms. Examining the tightness of the derived entanglement
    bound, we find that the set of pure states for which our relation is tight is
    strongly restricted. We show that for measurements in mutually unbiased bases
    the only pure states that saturate the bound are maximally entangled states on
    a subspace of the bipartite Hilbert space (this includes product states). We further
    show that our relation can also be employed for entanglement detection using generalized
    measurements, i.e. when not all measurement outcomes can be resolved individually
    by the detector. In addition, the impact of local conserved quantities on the
    detectable entanglement is discussed.'

  abstract: 'Entanglement is not only the resource that fuels many quantum technologies
    but also plays a key role for some of the most profound open questions of fundamental
    physics. Experiments controlling quantum systems at the single quantum level may
    shed light on these puzzles. However, measuring, or even bounding, entanglement
    experimentally has proven to be an outstanding challenge, especially when the
    prepared quantum states are mixed. We use entropic uncertainty relations for bipartite
    systems to derive measurable lower bounds on distillable entanglement. We showcase
    these bounds by applying them to physical models realizable in cold-atom experiments.
    The derived entanglement bounds rely on measurements in only two different bases
    and are generically applicable to any quantum simulation platform. '

    revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian
    distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small

  abstract: 'This paper introduces assignment flows for density matrices as state
    spaces for representation and analysis of data associated with vertices of an
    underlying weighted graph. Determining an assignment flow by geometric integration
    of the defining dynamical system causes an interaction of the non-commuting states
    across the graph, and the assignment of a pure (rank-one) state to each vertex
    after convergence. Adopting the Riemannian&ndash;Bogoliubov&ndash;Kubo&ndash;Mori
    metric from information geometry leads to closed-form local expressions that can
    be computed efficiently and implemented in a fine-grained parallel manner. Restriction
    to the submanifold of commuting density matrices recovers the assignment flows
    for categorical probability distributions, which merely assign labels from a finite
    set to each data point. As shown for these flows in our prior work, the novel
    class of quantum state assignment flows can also be characterized as Riemannian
    gradient flows with respect to a non-local, non-convex potential after proper
    reparameterization and under mild conditions on the underlying weight function.
    This weight function generates the parameters of the layers of a neural network
    corresponding to and generated by each step of the geometric integration scheme.

  abstract: 'Time reversal in a macroscopic system is contradicting daily experience.
    It is practically impossible to restore a shattered cup to its original state
    by just time reversing the microscopic dynamics that led to its breakage. Yet,
    with the precise control capabilities provided by modern quantum technology, the
    unitary evolution of a quantum system can be reversed in time. Here, we implement
    a time-reversal protocol in a dipolar interacting, isolated many-body spin system
    represented by Rydberg states in an atomic gas. By changing the states encoding
    the spin, we flip the sign of the interaction Hamiltonian, and demonstrate the
    reversal of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization by letting a demagnetized
    many-body state evolve back-in-time into a magnetized state. We elucidate the
    role of atomic motion using the concept of a Loschmidt echo. Finally, by combining
    the approach with Floquet engineering, we demonstrate time reversal for a large
    family of spin models with different symmetries. Our method of state transfer
    is applicable across a wide range of quantum simulation platforms and has applications
    far beyond quantum many-body physics, reaching from quantum-enhanced sensing to
