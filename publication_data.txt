  abstract: 'The approximation of quantum states with artificial neural networks has
    gained a lot of attention during the last years. Meanwhile, analog neuromorphic
    chips, inspired by structural and dynamical properties of the biological brain,
    show a high energy efficiency in running artificial neural-network architectures
    for the profit of generative applications. This encourages employing such hardware
    systems as platforms for simulations of quantum systems. Here we report on the
    realization of a prototype using the latest spike-based BrainScaleS hardware allowing
    us to represent few-qubit maximally entangled quantum states with high fidelities.
    Bell correlations of pure and mixed two-qubit states are well captured by the
    analog hardware, demonstrating an important building block for simulating quantum
    systems with spiking neuromorphic chips.'

    distributed entanglement in a particularly challenging setting: an ensemble of
    many cold atoms (see the Perspective by Cavalcanti). In all three studies, the

    an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used spin mixing in a tightly

    particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement
    can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We
    used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of
    quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct
    parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed
    a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.'

    in cold atom quantum simulators with Rydberg atoms. In these experiments, due
    to the Rydberg blockade effect, the degree of disorder in the system is effectively
    tunable by varying the spin density. We study dynamics and eigenstate properties
    of the model as a function of disorder strength and system size and discuss potential

  abstract: 'Path integrals with complex actions are encountered for many physical
    systems ranging from spin- or mass-imbalanced atomic gases and graphene to quantum
    chromodynamics at finite density to the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems.
    Many computational approaches have been developed for tackling the sign problem
    emerging for complex actions. Among these, complex Langevin dynamics has the appeal
    of general applicability. One of its key challenges is the potential convergence
    of the dynamics to unphysical fixed points. The statistical sampling process at
    such a fixed point is not based on the physical action and hence leads to wrong
    predictions. Moreover, its unphysical nature is hard to detect due to the implicit
    nature of the process. In the present work we set up a general approach based
    on a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme in an extended state space. In this approach
    we derive an explicit real sampling process for generalized complex Langevin dynamics.
    Subject to a set of constraints, this sampling process is the physical one. These
    constraints originate from the detailed-balance equations satisfied by the Monte
    Carlo scheme. This allows us to rederive complex Langevin dynamics from a new

    At the same time it poses a significant challenge as the evaluation of entanglement
    measures typically requires the full reconstruction of the quantum state, which
    is extremely costly in terms of measurement statistics. We derive an improved
    entanglement bound for bipartite systems, which requires measuring joint probability

    its power by applying it to currently operational experimental setups for quantum
