abstract: 'Modern day quantum simulators can prepare a wide variety of quantum states
  but extracting observables from the resulting "quantum data" often poses a challenge.
  We tackle this problem by developing a quantum state tomography scheme which relies
  on approximating the probability distribution over the outcomes of an informationally
  complete measurement in a variational manifold represented by a convolutional neural
  network. We show an excellent representability of prototypical ground- and steady
  states with this ansatz using a number of variational parameters that scales polynomially
  in system size. This compressed representation allows us to reconstruct states with
  high classical fidelities outperforming standard methods such as maximum likelihood
  estimation. Furthermore, it achieves a reduction of the root mean square errors
  of observables by up to an order of magnitude compared to their direct estimation
  from experimental data. '
