abstract: 'We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions
  of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate.
  We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical
  entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature
  of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even
  in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental
  implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples
  without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest
  neighbor estimators. '
