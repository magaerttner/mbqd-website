abstract: 'Understanding how closed quantum systems dynamically approach thermal equilibrium
  presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics. Generically, it is expected
  that non-integrable quantum systems thermalize as they comply with the Eigenstate
  Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). A notable exception to this is the phenomenon of
  many-body localization, where the emergence of local conserved quantities prevents
  thermalization, which has been observed in finite low-dimensional systems. We study
  an ensemble of Heisenberg spins with a tunable distribution of random coupling strengths
  realized by a Rydberg quantum simulator. The total magnetization as a function of
  external field after a quench serves as a probe for thermalization. We find that
  such an isolated quantum system exhibits a non-thermalizing regime despite being
  non-integrable. It is shown that thermalization can be restored by reducing the
  disorder in the coupling strengths. As our system consists of up to 4000 spins,
  we thus show that closed quantum systems can fail to reach thermal equilibrium even
  at system sizes approaching the thermodynamic limit.'
