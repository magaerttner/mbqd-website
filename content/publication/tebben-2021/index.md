abstract: 'We experimentally investigate the nonlinear transmission spectrum of coherent
  light fields propagating through a Rydberg-EIT medium with strong atomic interactions.
  In contrast to previous investigations, which have largely focused on resonant control
  fields, we explore here the full two-dimensional spectral response of the Rydberg
  gas. Our measurements confirm previously observed spectral features for a vanishing
  control-field detuning that are explainable by existing theories, but also reveal
  significant differences on two-photon resonance. In particular, we find qualitative
  deficiencies of mean-field models and rate-equation simulations in describing the
  nonlinear probe-field response under EIT conditions, suggesting spectral signatures
  of an interaction-induced resonance with laser-dressed entangled pair states. While
  this effect is captured by the third-order nonlinear susceptibility that accounts
  for pair-wise interaction effects, the experiments show that many-body processes
  beyond such two-body effects play a significant role already at surprisingly low
  probe-field intensities. These results suggest that a more complete understanding
  of Rydberg-EIT and emerging photon interactions requires to go beyond existing simplified
  models as well as few-photon theories.'
