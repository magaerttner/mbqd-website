abstract: 'Entanglement is not only the resource that fuels many quantum technologies
  but also plays a key role for some of the most profound open questions of fundamental
  physics. Experiments controlling quantum systems at the single quantum level may
  shed light on these puzzles. However, measuring, or even bounding, entanglement
  experimentally has proven to be an outstanding challenge, especially when the prepared
  quantum states are mixed. We use entropic uncertainty relations for bipartite systems
  to derive measurable lower bounds on distillable entanglement. We showcase these
  bounds by applying them to physical models realizable in cold-atom experiments.
  The derived entanglement bounds rely on measurements in only two different bases
  and are generically applicable to any quantum simulation platform. '
