abstract: 'Strongly interacting quantum systems subject to quenched disorder exhibit
  intriguing phenomena such as glassiness and many-body localization. Theoretical
  studies have mainly focused on disorder in the from of random potentials, while
  many experimental realizations naturally feature disorder in the interparticle interactions.
  Inspired by cold Rydberg gases, where such disorder can be engineered using the
  dipole blockade effect, we study a Heisenberg XXZ spin model where the disorder
  is exclusively due to random spin-spin couplings, arising from power-law interactions
  between randomly positioned spins. Using established spectral and eigenstate properties
  and entanglement entropy, we show that this system exhibits a localization crossover
  and identify strongly interacting pairs as emergent local conserved quantities in
  the system, leading to an intuitive physical picture consistent with our numerical
  results. '
