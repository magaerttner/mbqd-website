abstract: 'The approximation of quantum states with artificial neural networks has
  gained a lot of attention during the last years. Meanwhile, analog neuromorphic
  chips, inspired by structural and dynamical properties of the biological brain,
  show a high energy efficiency in running artificial neural-network architectures
  for the profit of generative applications. This encourages employing such hardware
  systems as platforms for simulations of quantum systems. Here we report on the realization
  of a prototype using the latest spike-based BrainScaleS hardware allowing us to
  represent few-qubit maximally entangled quantum states with high fidelities. Bell
  correlations of pure and mixed two-qubit states are well captured by the analog
  hardware, demonstrating an important building block for simulating quantum systems
  with spiking neuromorphic chips.'
