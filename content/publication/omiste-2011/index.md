abstract: 'We present a theoretical study of recent laser-alignment and mixed-field-orientation
  experiments of asymmetric top molecules. In these experiments{,} pendular states
  were created using linearly polarized strong ac electric fields from pulsed lasers
  in combination with weak electrostatic fields. We compare the outcome of our calculations
  with experimental results obtained for the prototypical large molecule benzonitrile
  (C7H5N) [J. L. Hansen et al.{,} Phys. Rev. A{,} 2011{,} 83{,} 023406.] and explore
  the directional properties of the molecular ensemble for several field configurations{,}
  i.e.{,} for various field strengths and angles between ac and dc fields. For perpendicular
  fields one obtains pure alignment{,} which is well reproduced by the simulations.
  For tilted fields{,} we show that a fully adiabatic description of the process does
  not reproduce the experimentally observed orientation{,} and it is mandatory to
  use a diabatic model for population transfer between rotational states. We develop
  such a model and compare its outcome to the experimental data confirming the importance
  of non-adiabatic processes in the field-dressed molecular dynamics.'
