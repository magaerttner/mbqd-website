abstract: 'We derive entropic inseparability criteria for the phase-space representation
  of quantum states. In contrast to criteria involving differential entropies of marginal
  phase-space distributions, our criteria are based on a joint distribution known
  as the Husimi Q distribution. This distribution is experimentally accessible in
  cold atoms, circuit QED architectures, and photonic systems, and bears practical
  advantages compared to the detection of marginals. We exemplify the strengths of
  our entropic approach by considering several classes of non-Gaussian states where
  second-order criteria fail. We show that our criteria certify entanglement in previously
  undetectable regions, highlighting the strength of using the Husimi Q distribution
  for entanglement detection.'
