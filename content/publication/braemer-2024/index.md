abstract: 'We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the cluster Truncated
  Wigner Approximation (cTWA) applied to quench dynamics in bond-disordered Heisenberg
  spin chains with power-law interactions. We find that cTWA yields highly accurate
  results over a wide parameter range. However, its accuracy hinges on a suitable
  choice of clusters. By using a clustering strategy inspired by the strong disorder
  renormalisation group (SDRG)/real-space renormalization group (RSRG), clusters of
  two spins are sufficient to obtain essentially exact results in the regime of strong
  disorder. Surprisingly, even for rather weak disorder, e.g.{\textbackslash} in the
  presence of very long-range interactions, this choice of clustering outperforms
  a naive choice of clusters of consecutive spins. Additionally, we develop a discrete
  sampling scheme for the initial Wigner function, as an alternative to the originally
  introduced scheme based on Gaussian approximations. This sampling scheme puts cTWA
  on the same conceptional footing as regular dTWA for single spins and yields some
  reduction in the Monte Carlo shot noise compared to the Gaussian scheme.'
