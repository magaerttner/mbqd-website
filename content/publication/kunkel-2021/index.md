abstract: 'A prerequisite for the comprehensive understanding of many-body quantum
  systems is a characterization in terms of their entanglement structure. The experimental
  detection of entanglement in spatially extended many-body systems describable by
  quantum fields still presents a major challenge. We develop a general scheme for
  certifying entanglement and demonstrate it by revealing entanglement between distinct
  subsystems of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Our scheme builds on the spatially
  resolved simultaneous detection of the quantum field in two conjugate observables
  which allows the experimental confirmation of quantum correlations between local
  as well as non-local partitions of the system. The detection of squeezing in Bogoliubov
  modes in a multi-mode setting illustrates its potential to boost the capabilities
  of quantum simulations to study entanglement in spatially extended many-body systems.'
