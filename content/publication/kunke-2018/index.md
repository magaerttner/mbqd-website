abstract: 'When particles in a quantum mechanical system are entangled, a measurement
  performed on one part of the system can affect the results of the same type of measurement
  performed on another part—even if these subsystems are physically separated. Kunkel
  et al., Fadel et al., and Lange et al. achieved this so-called distributed entanglement
  in a particularly challenging setting: an ensemble of many cold atoms (see the Perspective
  by Cavalcanti). In all three studies, the entanglement was first created within
  an atomic cloud, which was then allowed to expand. Local measurements on the different,
  spatially separated parts of the cloud confirmed that the entanglement survived
  the expansion.Science, this issue p. 413, p. 409, p. 416; see also p. 376A key resource
  for distributed quantum-enhanced protocols is entanglement between spatially separated
  modes. However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially
  separated regions of an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used spin
  mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state
  of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally
  that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of
  the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly
  strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering
  between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering,
  we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.'
