abstract: ' We present a theoretical study of the impact of an electric field combined
  with a magnetic field on the rotational dynamics of open-shell diatomic molecules.
  Within the rigid rotor approximation, we solve the time-independent Schrödinger
  equation including the fine-structure interactions and the Λ-doubling effects. We
  consider three sets of molecule-specific parameters and several field regimes and
  investigate the interplay between the different interactions identifying the dominant
  one. The possibility of inducing couplings between the spin and rotational degrees
  of freedom is demonstrated. '
