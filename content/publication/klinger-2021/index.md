abstract: 'We study excitation transport in a two-dimensional system of randomly assembled
  spins with power-law hopping in two dimensions. This model can be realized in cold
  atom quantum simulators with Rydberg atoms. In these experiments, due to the Rydberg
  blockade effect, the degree of disorder in the system is effectively tunable by
  varying the spin density. We study dynamics and eigenstate properties of the model
  as a function of disorder strength and system size and discuss potential limitations
  for experiments. At strong disorder we observe the absence of transport due to localized
  eigenstates with power-law tails. In this regime the spectral and eigenstate properties
  can be understood in a perturbative picture of states predominantly localized on
  small clusters of spins. As the disorder strength is weakened eigenstates become
  increasingly delocalized and appear multifractal for moderate system sizes. A detailed
  study of the system-size scaling of the eigenstate properties indicates that in
  the infinite size limit all state eventually become localized. We discuss the feasibility
  of observing localization effects experimentally in the spatial spreading of an
  initially localized excitation and identify limited system sizes and finite decoherence
  rates as major challenges. Our study paves the way towards an experimental observation
  of localization effects in Rydberg spin systems with tunable disorder. '
