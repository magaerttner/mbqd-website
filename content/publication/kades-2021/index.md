abstract: 'Path integrals with complex actions are encountered for many physical systems
  ranging from spin- or mass-imbalanced atomic gases and graphene to quantum chromodynamics
  at finite density to the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems. Many computational
  approaches have been developed for tackling the sign problem emerging for complex
  actions. Among these, complex Langevin dynamics has the appeal of general applicability.
  One of its key challenges is the potential convergence of the dynamics to unphysical
  fixed points. The statistical sampling process at such a fixed point is not based
  on the physical action and hence leads to wrong predictions. Moreover, its unphysical
  nature is hard to detect due to the implicit nature of the process. In the present
  work we set up a general approach based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme in
  an extended state space. In this approach we derive an explicit real sampling process
  for generalized complex Langevin dynamics. Subject to a set of constraints, this
  sampling process is the physical one. These constraints originate from the detailed-balance
  equations satisfied by the Monte Carlo scheme. This allows us to rederive complex
  Langevin dynamics from a new perspective and establishes a framework for the explicit
  construction of new sampling schemes for complex actions.'
