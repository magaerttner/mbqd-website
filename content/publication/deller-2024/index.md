abstract: 'The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing
  quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically
  and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear
  functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen
  classical entropies capture the very same features as their quantum analogs for
  an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well
  spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions
  of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically
  unbiased k-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum
  correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by
  a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions.
  We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers
  without assuming a specific functional form of the distributions, rendering our
  method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.'
