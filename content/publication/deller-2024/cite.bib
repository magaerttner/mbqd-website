      abstract={The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture the very same features as their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased k-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without assuming a specific functional form of the distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.}
