abstract: 'We explore a supervised machine learning approach to estimate the entanglement
  entropy of multi-qubit systems from few experimental samples. We put a particular
  focus on estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of the network''s estimate
  and benchmark against the best known conventional estimation algorithms. For states
  that are contained in the training distribution, we observe convergence in a regime
  of sample sizes in which the baseline method fails to give correct estimates, while
  extrapolation only seems possible for regions close to the training regime. As a
  further application of our method, highly relevant for quantum simulation experiments,
  we estimate the quantum mutual information for non-unitary evolution by training
  our model on different noise strengths. '
