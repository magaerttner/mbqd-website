abstract: 'We numerically study out-of-equilibrium dynamics in a family of Heisenberg
  models with $\frac{1}{r^6}$ power-law interactions and positional disorder. Using
  the semi-classical discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA) method, we investigate
  the time evolution of the magnetization and ensemble-averaged single-spin purity
  for a strongly disordered system after initializing the system in an out-of-equilibrium
  state. We find that both quantities display robust glassy behavior for almost any
  value of the anisotropy parameter of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a
  systematic analysis allows us to quantitatively show that, for all the scenarios
  considered, the stretch power lies close to the one analytically obtained in the
  Ising limit. This indicates that glassy relaxation behavior occurs widely in disordered
  quantum spin systems, independent of the particular symmetries and integrability
  of the Hamiltonian. '
