abstract: 'Controllable arrays of ions and ultracold atoms can simulate complex many-body
  phenomena and may provide insights into unsolved problems in modern science. To
  this end, experimentally feasible protocols for quantifying the buildup of quantum
  correlations and coherence are needed, as performing full state tomography does
  not scale favourably with the number of particles. Here we develop and experimentally
  demonstrate such a protocol, which uses time reversal of the many-body dynamics
  to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) in a long-range Ising
  spin quantum simulator with more than 100 ions in a Penning trap. By measuring a
  family of OTOCs as a function of a tunable parameter we obtain fine-grained information
  about the state of the system encoded in the multiple quantum coherence spectrum,
  extract the quantum state purity, and demonstrate the buildup of up to 8-body correlations.
  Future applications of this protocol could enable studies of many-body localization,
  quantum phase transitions, and tests of the holographic duality between quantum
  and gravitationalÂ systems.'
