abstract: 'Time reversal in a macroscopic system contradicts daily experience. It
  is practically impossible to restore a shattered cup to its original state by just
  time reversing the microscopic dynamics that led to its breakage. Yet, with the
  precise control capabilities provided by modern quantum technology, the unitary
  evolution of a quantum system can be reversed in time. Here, we implement a time-reversal
  protocol in a dipolar interacting, isolated many-body spin system represented by
  Rydberg states in an atomic gas. By changing the states encoding the spin, we flip
  the sign of the interaction Hamiltonian, and demonstrate the reversal of the relaxation
  dynamics of the magnetization by letting a demagnetized many-body state evolve back
  in time into a magnetized state. We elucidate the role of atomic motion using the
  concept of a Loschmidt echo. Finally, by combining the approach with Floquet engineering,
  we demonstrate time reversal for a large family of spin models with different symmetries.
  Our method of state transfer is applicable across a wide range of quantum simulation
  platforms and has applications far beyond quantum many-body physics, reaching from
  quantum-enhanced sensing to quantum information scrambling.                                                                               Published
