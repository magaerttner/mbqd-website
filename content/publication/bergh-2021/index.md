abstract: 'We study experimentally accessible lower bounds on entanglement measures
  based on entropic uncertainty relations. Experimentally quantifying entanglement
  is highly desired for applications of quantum simulation experiments to fundamental
  questions, e.g. in quantum statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. At
  the same time it poses a significant challenge as the evaluation of entanglement
  measures typically requires the full reconstruction of the quantum state, which
  is extremely costly in terms of measurement statistics. We derive an improved entanglement
  bound for bipartite systems, which requires measuring joint probability distributions
  in only two different measurement settings per subsystem, and demonstrate its power
  by applying it to currently operational experimental setups for quantum simulation
  with cold atoms. Examining the tightness of the derived entanglement bound, we find
  that the set of pure states for which our relation is tight is strongly restricted.
  We show that for measurements in mutually unbiased bases the only pure states that
  saturate the bound are maximally entangled states on a subspace of the bipartite
  Hilbert space (this includes product states). We further show that our relation
  can also be employed for entanglement detection using generalized measurements,
  i.e. when not all measurement outcomes can be resolved individually by the detector.
  In addition, the impact of local conserved quantities on the detectable entanglement
  is discussed.'
