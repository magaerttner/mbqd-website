abstract: 'We study out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the quantum Ising model with power-law
  interactions and positional disorder. For arbitrary dimension d and interaction
  range α≥d we analytically find a stretched exponential decay with stretch power
  β=d/α for the global magnetization and ensemble-averaged single-spin purity in the
  thermodynamic limit. We reveal numerically that glassy behavior persists for finite
  system sizes and sufficiently strong disorder. We conclude that the magnetization
  decay is due to interaction induced dephasing while entanglement builds up at a
  smaller rate evident from the decay of single-spin purity, thus providing a microscopic
  understanding of glassy dynamics in disordered closed quantum systems.'
