abstract: 'Understanding how closed quantum systems dynamically approach thermal equilibrium
  presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics. Generically, non-integrable
  quantum systems are expected to thermalize as they comply with the Eigenstate Thermalization
  Hypothesis. However, in the presence of strong disorder, the dynamics can possibly
  slow down to a degree that systems fail to thermalize on experimentally accessible
  timescales, as in spin glasses or many-body localized systems. In general, particularly
  in long-range interacting quantum systems, the specific nature of the disorder necessary
  for the emergence of a prethermal, metastable state--distinctly separating the timescales
  of initial relaxation and subsequent slow thermalization--remains an open question.
  We study an ensemble of Heisenberg spins with a tunable distribution of random coupling
  strengths realized by a Rydberg quantum simulator. We observe a drastic change in
  the late-time magnetization when increasing disorder strength. The data is well
  described by models based on pairs of strongly interacting spins, which are treated
  as thermal for weak disorder and isolated for strong disorder. Our results indicate
  a crossover into a pair-localized prethermal regime in a closed quantum system of
  thousands of spins in the critical case where the exponent of the power law interaction
  matches the spatial dimension. '
