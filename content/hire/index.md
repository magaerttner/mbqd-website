We currently donâ€™t have any open PhD or Postdoc positions. However, we are always looking for motivated Bachelor and Master students.
Topics of interest cover the whole range from quantum information and computation to quantum many-body physics, with a focus on machine learning methods for quantum technologies and quantum simulation.

Possible research topics include:
- Development of variational simulation methods for quantum many-body systems
- Characterization of noisy quantum devices and state tomography
- Quantum enhanced imaging and sensing
- Entanglement detection
- Quantum simulation
- Quantum thermalization
- More information on topics covered in the group can be found on our research pages.
