## Postdoc position in algorithm design for Rydberg quantum computers

We are seeking a highly qualified **postdoctoral researcher** for a project on the **design and simulation of state-preparation schemes with Rydberg atom quantum computers using multi-atom gates**. The position is part of a collaboration project between Jena, Stuttgart, and Ulm in the framework of the qPhoton initiative funded by the Carl-Zeiss foundation. The goal of this collaboration is it to devise and experimentally demonstrate schemes for efficient preparation of tensor network states, which make optimal use of the unique capabilities of the Rydberg platform. 

The position will be in the group of Martin Gärttner (Quantum Information and Quantum Simulation [www.qiqs-jena.de]) at the Institute of Condensed Matter Theory and Optics at Jena University. The project will be supervised by Martin Gärttner and collaboration with other members of the Gärttner group working on related topics are envisioned. Close collaborations with the project partners Patrick Emonts (Ulm) and Tilmann Pfau/Florian Meinert (Ulm) are expected. Collaborations with other groups within the qPhoton consortium and contributions to a possible follow up grant proposal are encouraged.

We advertise a **full position** (100%, or 39.5h/week) with payment according to TVL payment class E13. There are no formal teaching duties but participation in teaching activities is possible.
The candidate is expected to hold a PhD in theoretical physics and bring in expertise on numerical simulation methods, preferably in quantum many-body dynamics, quantum optics, or cold atom physics. Experience in numerical simulation of open quantum systems, ideally experience with neutral atom quantum computing using Rydberg states, tensor network states, or adiabatic state preparation are a plus. Previous experience in collaborations with experimental groups will be beneficial.

Applications should include a cover letter (including motivation for applying to this position), a CV (including publication list), a copy of the applicant's master and PhD certificate and academic transcripts (all collated in a single pdf file). Applicants should also provide the contacts of at least two people who could potentially provide a reference letter. All documents shall be sent to [martin.gaerttner@uni-jena.de].
 
The offered position will run for at least 2 years. Review of the applications will begin on **December 27th 2025**. The position should start as soon as possible, but we offer some flexibility concerning the starting date and keep looking for suitable candidates until the position is filled.

## Always looking for motivated Bachelor and Master students!

We currently don’t have any open PhD positions. However, we are always looking for motivated **bachelor and master students**.

Topics of interest cover the whole range from quantum information and computation to quantum many-body physics, with a focus on machine learning methods for quantum technologies and quantum simulation.

Possible research topics include:
- Development of variational simulation methods for quantum many-body systems
- Characterization of noisy quantum devices and state tomography
- Quantum enhanced imaging and sensing
- Entanglement detection
- Quantum simulation
- Quantum thermalization
- More information on topics covered in the group can be found on our research pages.

## How to apply
To apply, please email [martin.gaerttner@uni-jena.de](mailto:martin.gaerttner@uni-jena.de) including your CV and transcript of records.
