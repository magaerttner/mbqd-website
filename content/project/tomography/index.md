Quantum measurements are distinctly different from classical ones in that they inevitably affect the state of the system to some degree. This leads to subtleties when trying to characterize quantum states from experimental data, a highly relevant task for quantum technologies. We design measurement strategies that allow characterizing quantum state in a maximally sample efficient way using a feedback loop. We also investigate how to correct experimental errors occurring during the readout process though post-processing of the measurement data.
