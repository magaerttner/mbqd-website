When people ask me, what I am doing, I usually explain that the world consists of two kinds of species: fermions and bosons – particles that like to antibunch and to cuddle respectively – and that I am working with the latter kind. Multimode bosonic systems are especially interesting as photonic systems represent a potential platform for quantum computing, a realistic application! Using Machine Learning techniques, I investigate how one can represent such systems efficiently.
