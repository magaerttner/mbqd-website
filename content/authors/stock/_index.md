In quantum computing, it is of great importance that initialized states can be tested and verified. However, to achieve optimal error scaling of a tomography scheme, at least in post-processing, the projective measurement must be performed in the eigenbasis of the true state. We therefore aim to develop a tomography method that adapts its measurement basis during the experiment and operates at the speed of the experiment.
