Quantum mechanics is considered hard to work with. Why not turning this around in our favor? The goal of my research is to solve hard problems using quantum computers. Quantum computers are intrinsically quantum mechanical and speak the quantum language (aka linear algebra). This means they are the best candidate for simulating physical systems. I am mostly interested in the simulation of optical systems and to achieve practical advantages by developing quantum algorithms for that. Sometimes, I also sneak into foundational and mathematical aspects of quantum mechanics. Does any of you know why there is no time operator in the current formulation of quantum mechanics?

My PhD project is co-supervised by Falk Eilenberger.
