Two hundred years BCE, the ancient Greeks were able to estimate astronomical positions and eclipses with the Antikythera mechanism, a device that mechanically captured aspects of the logic of planetary orbits - an early concept of an analog computer.

Today, we can extend this idea into the quantum realm.

Quantum simulation on continuous-variable platforms enables the realization of quantum computation in an analog fashion. Much like the Antikythera mechanism, a well-controlled laboratory quantum system can be engineered to emulate a more complex target system, offering the potential to achieve computational quantum advantage. However, experimental implementations are often limited by incomplete knowledge of the quantum state and by strong noise. In my thesis, I aim to address these challenges by developing methods to correct the outputs of Gaussian boson samplers, with the goal of improving their reliability as tools for quantum simulation.
