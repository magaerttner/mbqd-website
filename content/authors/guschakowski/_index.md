The topic of my master thesis will be the development of a quantum algorithm for solving Maxwell’s equations in inhomogeneous space. The goal is creating a specialized algorithm, better suited to the problem at hand than existing general algorithms, which largely rely on matrix inversion. Central objectives will be developing the algorithm, running simulations, and error analysis.
