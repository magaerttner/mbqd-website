**What happened to my quantum state!?**

It turns out, a lot of things can happen in your quantum state. My research interests revolve around characterization of quantum states, noise channels and measurement operators and how to extract the most amount of information from them. I mainly focus on using Bayesian inference to optimize measurement strategies, detector tomography to perform noise characterization and readout error correction.
