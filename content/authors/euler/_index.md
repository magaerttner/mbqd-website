Understanding the structure of entanglement in quantum states prepared in experiments can be quite tricky.
I come up with methods and measurement schemes that utilize the limited tools and readout at hand to deliver new insights on a microscopic level.
My efforts up until now have been focused on ultracold quantum gases, but I now also start working on photonic systems.
Furthermore, I am also interested in driven many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium.
In particular, I study the stability of long-range order in space and time using numerical methods.
