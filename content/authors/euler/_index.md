Understanding the structure of entanglement in quantum states prepared in experiments can be quite tricky.
I come up with methods and measurement schemes that utilize the limited tools and readout at hand to deliver new insights on a microscopic level.
My efforts have been focused on detecting high-dimensional entanglement in ultracold quantum gases, and more recently, also in photonic systems.
Further interests include driven many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium.
