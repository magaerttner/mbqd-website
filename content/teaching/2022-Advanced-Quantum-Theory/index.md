This lecture will give an introduction to quantum information theory and theory of open quantum systems. The lecture will be accompanied by exercises and bi-weekly tutorials.

Topics include:
- Recap of basic quantum mechanics: Postulates, qubit systems, density matrix
- Quantum measurement
- Quantum entanglement
- Schmidt decomposition and purifications
- EPR paradox and Bell inequalities
- Quantum channels
- Distance measures between quantum states
- Classical and quantum entropy
- Quantum thermalization
- Lindblad Master equation
