Rydberg atoms are a versatile quantum simulator platform and allow for long coherence and a high degree of tunability. For example, they can straight-forwardly realize a Heisenberg XXZ model with power-law couplings where the Rydberg blockade radius allows for tuning the width of the coupling's distribution. We show via numerical simulation, that this system exhibits a localization crossover making it well suited for studying MBL and its mechanism in mesoscopic systems for beyond the reach of numerically exact methods.
